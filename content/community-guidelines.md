##Welcome to the Sigmanauts DAO Community!

We’re thrilled to have you here! Our channels are built to foster a friendly, inclusive, and constructive environment where everyone can collaborate and explore the potential of the Ergo blockchain. Together, let’s ensure this remains a welcoming space for all. Here’s how we do that:

- Respectful and Civil Conversations: We value open-minded discussions and respect for each other’s perspectives. Share your thoughts with kindness and avoid personal attacks. Let’s keep the focus on constructive ideas, even when we disagree.

- Embrace Inclusivity: Everyone is welcome here, regardless of background. Celebrate diversity, and help create an environment free of discrimination or offensive language. Let’s build each other up!

- Privacy and Security: Be mindful of the information you share and protect the privacy of others. Discussions within the community should remain within the community, so respect the confidentiality of what’s shared.

- Contribute, Don’t Spam: Our community thrives on valuable contributions. Keep posts relevant and avoid spamming or self-promotion. Let’s make sure every post adds to the conversation.

- Collaborative Decisions: We make decisions together as a DAO. Your participation is encouraged, so engage constructively and support our collective decision-making process.

- Handling Conflicts with Respect: If disagreements or issues arise, resolve them privately and respectfully. We’re all here to grow, so handle conflicts maturely without causing drama. If a serious violation occurs, it may lead to community discussions, chat timeouts, chat bans, and/or DAO votes to resolve the matter.

- Community Ownership: This space belongs to all of us, and your input is vital. Help maintain a positive atmosphere and participate in shaping our growing community.

- Follow Platform Rules: Please respect both Sigmanauts DAO’s terms and the terms of the platforms we use, like Telegram or Discord.

By participating, you’re helping to build a vibrant, respectful, and forward-thinking community. Thanks for being part of Sigmanauts! For more detailed language and our mission statement, please visit https://sigmanauts.com/
